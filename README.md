### Hi, 
Here is short blurbed notes on me.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- I’m currently working as a Machine Learning Engineer.
- I’m primarily focused on Proabilistic Machine Learning Models, Statistical Learning, and Numerical Optimization.
- I’m looking to collaborate on solving real world uncertainities with probabilistic approach. 
- How to reach me: [email](aditigajurel32@gmail.com)
- Fun fact: I can't think of any now. Will update if I get any :)
