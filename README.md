### Hi, 
Here are short notes on me.


- I'm currently working as a Machine Learning Engineer.
- I’m primarily focused on Probabilistic Machine Learning Models, Statistical Learning, and Numerical Optimization.
- I’m looking to collaborate on solving real-world uncertainties with a probabilistic approach. 
- Reach me via [email](aditigajurel32@gmail.com)
- Fun fact: I can't think of any now. I Will update if I get any :)
